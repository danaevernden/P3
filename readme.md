##Details for teaching team
I had a bit of difficulty at first with understanding how routes/controllers/views talk to each other, so I took some additional time towards the end of putting this project together to address that. I challenged myself on Thursday night by giving myself hour to add the password generator to the application and was successful :) That showed me that I finally understood routes/controllers/views! With all that said, I didn't spend much time on the CSS.
